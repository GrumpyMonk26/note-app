# Note App

#### Vanilla Javascript Project

#### Project description

##### In this project, we will develop a stylish and modern note-taking app with a sleek button design. By clicking the button, users can create new notes and edit them as required. To ensure user-friendly functionality, double-clicking a note will prompt a confirmation dialogue before deleting it. Furthermore, notes will be saved using browser local storage, allowing them to persist even after refreshing the page. This project encompasses the implementation of JavaScript to save and retrieve notes, as well as the creation of a visually appealing glassy interface using CSS.
